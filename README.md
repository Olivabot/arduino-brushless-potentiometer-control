# arduino-brushless-potentiometer-control
Control a brushless DC motor using an Arduino and an Electronic Speed Controller (ESC). This project utilizes a potentiometer to adjust motor speed and includes serial debugging for real-time monitoring of potentiometer values and motor performance. Ideal for robotics and DIY motor control applications.
